# SQL Data Analysis Project - MySQL Workbench

## Overview

This project demonstrates fundamental SQL operations used in data analysis, specifically targeting a music database containing tables such as `Album`, `Artist`, `Customer`, `Employee`, `Genre`, `Invoice`, `MediaType`, `Playlist`, `PlaylistTrack`, and `Track`.

## Objectives

- Use `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, and `GROUP BY` clauses.
- Perform various types of `JOIN` operations (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT).
- Create subqueries for advanced filtering and analysis.
- Use aggregate functions like `SUM()` and `AVG()`.
- Create and view SQL views.
- Create and inspect indexes to optimize queries.
